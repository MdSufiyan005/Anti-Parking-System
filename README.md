## ❗ Problem Statement

Illegal parking has become a critical issue in urban cities across India, leading to:

- 🚗 Traffic congestion and reduced mobility
- 💥 Increased accident risks
- 🤬 Street fights and interpersonal conflicts
- ⏱️ Wasted time and resources

> **Research Insight:** 85% of people regularly observe illegal parking, with 65% experiencing direct inconvenience as a result.

## 💡 Conceptual Solution

We designed an intelligent detection system with the following workflow:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Architecture.png" alt="Solution Workflow" width="700">
</p>

1. **📸 Vehicle Detection**: Camera captures image of illegally parked vehicle
2. **🔢 License Plate Recognition**: AI extracts number plate information
3. **👤 Owner Identification**: System checks vehicle registration database
4. **📱 Automated Warning**: SMS notification with grace period for removal
5. **💰 E-Challan Generation**: Automatic fine issuance for non-compliance
6. **🚜 Towing Integration**: Alerts to towing authorities for persistent violations

### Technologies (Conceptual)

- 🧠 Computer Vision AI models
- ☁️ Cloud databases
- 📨 Automated notification systems
- 🔄 Integration with traffic management infrastructure
